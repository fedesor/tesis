Digilent Adept Runtime for Linux Change Log
===========================================

Adept Runtime for Linux 2.10.2 (07/12/2012):
    1. Added support for IEEE 1149.7-2009 by extending the DJTG API set to
       include the following functions: DjtgSetScanFormat,
       DjtgGetScanFormat, DjtgSetReadyCnt, DjtgGetReadyCnt,
       DjtgSetDelayCnt, DjtgGetDelayCnt, DjtgCheckPacket, and DjtgEscape.
       Please note that not all of Digilent's programming solutions are
       capable of interfacing with IEEE 1149.7-2009 targets.
    2. Added IEEE 1149.7-2009 for the JTAG-HS2 and JTAG-SMT2.
    3. Modified the UDEV rules file ("52-digilent-usb.rules") to use the
       "ATTR{}" syntax for matching SYSFS attributes. Previously the
       "SYSFS{}" syntax was used for matching SYSFS attributes, which
       resulted in users being required to have superuser privileges when
       accessing Digilent USB devices on distributions running UDEV version
       174 or newer (Fedora 17 and Ubuntu 12.04). While not officially
       supported, this version of the Adept Runtime for Linux has been
       confirmed to work with Fedora 17 and Ubuntu 12.04.
    4. Modified install script ("install.sh") to detect which version of
       UDEV is installed and install a UDEV rules file that uses the
       "SYSFS{}" syntax for matching SYSFS attributes when appropriate
       (UDEV versions prior to 098).

Adept Runtime for Linux 2.9.9 (04/06/2012):
    1. Fixed a bug that caused a segfault under distributions running
       Kernel 3. While not officially supported, the Adept Runtime for
       Linux has been confirmed to work with Fedora 16 and Ubuntu 11.10
       after this bugfix was implemented.

Adept Runtime for Linux 2.9.8 (03/29/2012):
    1. Fixed a bug that was preventing multiple users from opening a handle
       to the same device.

Adept Runtime for Linux 2.9.7 (03/27/2012):
    1. Fixed a bug that caused inconsistent behavior while using GDB to
       debug applications that were linked against the Runtime.

Adept Runtime for Linux 2.9.6 (03/09/2012):
    1. Added support for new USB devices: JTAG-HS2, JTAG-SMT2, and ZED.
    
Adept Runtime for Linux 2.9.5 (02/17/2012):
    1. Fixed a bug in install script that was causing the UDEV rules not to
       be installed under distributions running Kernel 3.
